# tic-tac-toe

Welcome to my first code!!!

I just build my first web-development project. A popular game called tic tac toe, it was also the most popular start-up coding project for beginners.
So I test my skill of using html, css and javascript.

* the whole code are stack in one file including css and javascript.
* Font-family: Fredoka from Google fonts.
* html 5 version.
* for educational purposes only.
* beginners game project for front end.
* The bot AI was not complete yet( meaning the project was not done yet ).

The design was a copy or inspired by Anuj Tic-Tac-Toe in Figma, The link was down below.
